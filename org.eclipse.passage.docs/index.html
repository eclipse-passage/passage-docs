    <p>Passage puts you product and/or it's features under license protection.</p>
    <p>To make it do so you should take several steps.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Done by <a href="html/dev-guide.html">product development</a>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>declare what in the product is protected by license (it can be the whole product or/and some
                    particular features);
                </li>
                <li>implant license checks in proper points in the product codebase;</li>
                <li>configure Passage Access Cycle for your particular needs or clone one of the existing
                    configurations.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p> From this point the product is treated as protected by Passage.
            </p>
            <p> Now we need to issue a license for our product to make Passage let ua user to use the product. This is
                done with two steps.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Done by product management: create licensing metadata for the product</p>
            <ul>
                <li> define product, features and their versions under licensing protection,</li>
                <li>generate encryption keys,</li>
                <li>create license plan</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These step begets several artifacts (now xmi files) that are quite precious and should be kept with
                care.</p>
        </li>

        <li><p>Done by sales management:</p>
            <p>license issuing boils down to a simple wizard passing which ends up by a pack of license files storing on
                a file system.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> Done by doc team:</p>
            <p>This step is to be performed by the product's user, but should definitely be documented: when a user gets
                your product and a license, how they should apply the license to the product.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
