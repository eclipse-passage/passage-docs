		<p>Passage puts you product and/or it's features under license
			protection.</p>
		<p>To make it do so you should take several steps.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li><p>
					Done by <a href="dev-guide.html">product development</a>:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>declare what in the product is protected by license (it
						can be the whole product or/and some particular features);</li>
					<li>implant license checks in proper points in the product
						code base;</li>
					<li>configure Passage Access Cycle for your particular needs
						or clone one of the existing configurations.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>From this point the product is treated as protected by
					Passage.</p>
				<p>Now we need to issue a license for our product to make
					Passage let ua user to use the product. This is done with two
					steps.</p></li>

			<li>
				<p>Done by product management: create licensing metadata for the
					product</p>
				<ul>
					<li>define product, features and their versions under
						licensing protection,</li>
					<li>generate encryption keys,</li>
					<li>create license plan</li>
				</ul>
				<p>These step begets several artifacts (now xmi files) that are
					quite precious and should be kept with care.</p>
			</li>

			<li><p>Done by sales management:</p>
				<p>license issuing boils down to a simple wizard passing which
					ends up by a pack of license files storing on a file system.</p></li>
			<li>
				<p>Done by doc team:</p>
				<p>This step is to be performed by the product's user, but
					should definitely be documented: when a user gets your product and
					a license, how they should apply the license to the product.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
